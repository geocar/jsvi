<i>jsvi</i> is a vi-clone written in pure javascript and should work
in any modern web-browser.

<i>jsvi</i> has a finger-feel of vi, supports a number of ed/ex commands,
is unicode-aware, supports real-time, check-as-you-type spell checking,
a small subset of HTML for useful for physical markup of text, and host

It is <b>not</b> based on the so-called "Rich Editor" that is
built into modern Firefox builds, and MSIE, and as a result, works
reliably on Safari and Opera.
